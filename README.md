Company Introduction

CarCompany is one of Europe's largest trading platforms for used cars, with around 400.000 cars created on our platform. The core service is an auction platform where dealerships can trade used cars. This facilitates trade between dealerships focused on new cars with dealerships only selling used cars. New-car dealerships have cars to sell as they provide customers a trade-in price for their old car as a service offering.

Case Introduction

As CarCompany scales into a larger company, knowledge of current and past performance becomes critical. Especially in the Guarantee Price department, due to the inherent risk of offering Guarantee Prices. If CarCompany guarantees a price higher than the final price on the auction, CarCompany covers the difference for the seller. If the price on auction is higher than the guaranteed price, the seller keeps the difference. This is only the case when the guaranteed price is accepted by the seller, as there is a fee associated with this. To accommodate the risk, monitoring of team performance and trends within this department is crucial to be aware of any increased risk.

Task

The IT department has sent you a dataset with an extract of cars which has previously been sold and where a guaranteed price has been provided. The purpose of the analysis is to inform management about guarantee price performance. 
Please use the dataset to investigate and provide insights on the questions below.


Requested insights from management
• CarCompany loses money if we provide a Guaranteed Price (GP) higher than the sold price. What is the distribution where GP is higher 
than the sold price, equal to the sold price, and lower than the sold price? Are there any other interesting splits we can do to analyze this further?


• Not all guaranteed prices provided by CarCompany get accepted by our customers. What percentage of provided GPs are accepted? 
What the ranking of employees (guaranteed_price_provider) based on acceptance rate? What more can we look into in relation to 
acceptance of guaranteed prices?


• Is there a correlation between the sold price of the car and the guarantee price? We have an assumption that a more expensive
car would make the customers more interested in accepting the guaranteed price. Is this correct?
